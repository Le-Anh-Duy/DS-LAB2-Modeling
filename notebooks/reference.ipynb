      "We note that for these systems external system parameters such as the (proximity) spin-orbit coupling and gating are able to sensitively alter its properties~\\cite{han_large_2024, lu_fractional_2024, zhou_fractional_2024, dong_theory_2024, choi_superconductivity_2025, waters_chern_2025, lu_extended_2025}.\n",

To achieve this gap within a $U$-only mean-field calculation we need $U = 4.8t$, where $t$ is the nearest-neighbor hopping parameter~\\cite{lee_gate-tunable_2022}, which significantly surpasses the $U = 3.5t$ estimate of the constrained random phase approximation (cRPA)~\\cite{wehling_strength_2011} and even the anti-ferromagnetic critical value of monolayer graphene $U = 2.2t$~\\cite{sorella_semi-metal-insulator_1992}. \n",

      "On the contrary, inclusion of non-local Fock terms as in PBE0 hybrid functional allows to adequately estimate the 39~meV band gap for R3G~\\cite{pamuk_magnetic_2017}, but overestimates the experimental gaps for ABCA stacked graphene or R4G of the order of $\\sim 10$~meV~\\cite{Kerelsky_moireless_2021, liu_spontaneous_2023}. \n",

We examined the energy dispersion near the Dirac point for R3G and R4G using the FTB model, as well as the $F_2G_2$ and $F_1G_0$ models for both the $\\hat{H}^0$ and the $\\hat{H}^{{\\rm TB}+U+V}$. As illustrated in \\Cref{Fig:figB1_a}, we confirmed that not only $F_2G_2$ but also $F_1G_0$ terms listed in \\Cref{tab:simplemodel} can significantly simplify the model without substantial loss of accuracy, both for $\\hat{H}^0$ and the self-consistent $\\hat{H}^{{\\rm TB}+U+V}$. Furthermore, we observed that applying the simplified parameters of the $F_1G_0$ model for R3G to R4G resulted in no significant differences in band structure or ground state near the Dirac point and therefore can be used for all RnG models. \n",

      "As shown in \\Cref{Fig:bilayerG}, we tested the validity of the TB+$U$+$V$ model for describing the band gap in biased bilayer graphene. For the DFT(+$U$+$V$) calculations in this test, a $90 \\times 90 \\times 1$ $k$-space grid was employed. We first confirmed that DFT+$U$+$V$ can correct the band gap underestimation typically found in LDA and yields results in good agreement with experimental data~\\cite{zhang_direct_2009}. In contrast, TB+$U$+$V$ and DFT+$U$+$V$ results did not initially agree, and we found that a modification to the Hartree potential was necessary to reconcile the two approaches.\n",

      "In \\Cref{eq:Hartree}, the $G_0$ ($\\bm{G}=0$) component is generally neglected under the assumption of charge neutrality. However, in a biased system, the $G_0$ term in the interlayer Hartree interaction needs to be considered. This term can be obtained by taking the limit $|q|\\to0$ as\n",

Notably, Hartree model calculation based on tight-binding parameters from previously LDA-based study~\\cite{jung_tight-binding_2013} also produced consistent with the LDA when the doubled $G_0$ term was used. This suggests that the doubling of the $G_0$ component is general with respect to the transformation of the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian into tight-binding bases. While we have not determined the exact origin of this doubling, one possible explanation could be the neglect of exchange-correlation potential. \n",
